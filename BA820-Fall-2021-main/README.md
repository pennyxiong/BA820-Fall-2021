# BA820: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Text Analytics - Fall 2021

This repo contains the materials for a course in unsupervised machine learning and text analytics with python.  Students should plan to close this repo and pull the most recent changes before each class meeting.

This class will use QTools for:

- Assignment submission and exams
- Larger Annoucements
- Gradebook
- Examples of assignment submissions, team project references, and test formats.

The majority of the resources will be found here in this repo, that will be constantly updated over the course of the semester.  

> I will also be making use of the Discussions section on the Github Repo.  This will act as public discussions and forums for topics specific to this class. I have found that Q&A style forums have worked well in my past deliveries of the course, as it centers the conversations on specific topics.



## Schedule

Each class session is as follows (Boston-local time):

1. Cohort A starting at 9:25 AM in Room 222
2. Cohort B starting at 2:30 PM Room 222 


## Syllabus

The link below is available via your BU accounts.

[BA820 Fall 2021 Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHaUHwrGPAwQNPToevSp0ERdEb4iKJAUtK58SUJzHg8/edit?usp=sharing)

> NOTE: I reserve the right to modify the syllabus at any time at my discretion.


## Requirements

- BU-associated Google account
- Google Cloud Account setup and any appropriate projects created (I have submitted the request to get our course added for a $50 GCP credit)
- A python coding environment where you are able to install packages.  This could be Colab or a local coding environment like VS Code.

## Setup

- We will be using Big Query for our datasets this semester.  For ease-of-use, you may want to pin the dataset (i.e. database) that will have the tables for our work.  The dataset/tables are available via `questrom.datasets`.  __PRIOR TO CLASS__ you should have tested that you can access the tables.  For example, count the number of records in the `diamonds` table.

> Should you have any issues, please post issues to our Forums on Questrom Tools.  Also, a friendly reminder per above to use the code in the syllabus to redeem your GCP credits affiliated with this course.
